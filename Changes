Revision history for WWW::Sitebase

0.10    2014-01-18
        - Added Mozilla::CA prerequisite so that SSL works with
          LWP::UserAgent 6.0 defaults.
        - Changed "agent" setting in WWW::Sitebase::Navigator to report
          the browser as Safari running on MacOS 10.9.1.
        - When checking pages against regexps, WWW::Sitebase::Navigator
          now uses /ism instead of /i as the flags.  This means a regexp
          like "Sign Out.*My Accounts" will properly return true if the
          page contains "Sign Out" on one line and "My Accounts" on another.

        - Improved handling of default_options to allow sub-classes
          more flexibility and backwards-compatibility when
          adding options.
        - Fixed examples in docs in Sitebase::Navigator to refer to
          using decoded_content instead of content method.
        - Fixed some Sitebase::Navigator docs that referred to Bebo.

0.08    2009-08-10
        - Fixed handling and documentation of default_options
        - Fixed bug in Sitebase::save method to make it work as
          documented

0.07    2009-08-08
        - Updated Navigor to use decoded_content instead of content method
          when checking pages for regular expressions. This solves
          problems that can occur when scanning pages with UTF-8
          encoding.

0.06    2007-08-04
        - Added use tests for Navigator and Poster in 01-load.t

0.05    2007-08-03
        - Added prerequisites to Makefile.PL
        - Updated Navigator docs to mention adding Crypt::SSLEay for
          subclasses that navigate SSL pages.

0.04    2007-08-02
        - Fixed capitalization of Sitebase module name.

0.03    2007-07-31
        - Corrected version 0.02 release date
        - Added "login_form_no" and "login_form_name" fields to site_info hash.
          This fixes an obvious bug in which logins would fail if the login form
          wasn't the second one on the page (which, oddly, it usually is...).
        - Added _submit_login method which can be overridden if needed to
          provide more control over the login form.
        - Fixed docs for submit_form.
        - Included Navigator and Poster in the distribution...

        - get_page now returns undef if it can't get the page or
          if the page doesn't match the provided RE after retrying
          20 times.
        - Added follow_to and follow_link methods.
        - _go_home method now goes to site's homepage if not
          logged in.
        - Fixed bugs in submit_form and _get_home.
        - Added debug method.
        - Cleaned Bebo-specific code from Base.pm
        - Changed "site" method name to "browser" in Sitebase.pm and
          Base.pm
        - Added Poster.pm (needs debugging).
        - Debugged Poster.pm. :)
        - Fixed max_count bug in Poster.pm (0.2).
        - Added post_count method to Poster.pm (0.3)
        - Renamed Sitebase::Base -> Sitebase.
        - Renamed Sitebase -> Sitebase::Navigator.
          - Structure now is:
            - Sitebase contains basic param validation, etc. It really
              could be used for almost any module.
            - Sitebase::Navigator is the base class for navigating
              web sites
            - Sitebase::Poster is an iterator for calling a posting method
              and remembering who was posted to.
        - Fixed documentation and package names
        - Updated Changes file with previous changes.

        First version.
        Includes WWW::Sitebase and WWW::Sitebase::Base, which
        is my general base class with handy generic parsing and
        load/save methods and should probably be renamed to
        "BaseClass" or something.
