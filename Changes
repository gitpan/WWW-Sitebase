        - Added prerequisites to Makefile.PL
        - Updated Navigator docs to mention adding Crypt::SSLEay for
          subclasses that navigate SSL pages.

0.04    2007-08-02
        - Fixed capitalization of Sitebase module name.

0.03    2007-07-31
        - Corrected version 0.02 release date
        - Added "login_form_no" and "login_form_name" fields to site_info hash.
          This fixes an obvious bug in which logins would fail if the login form
          wasn't the second one on the page (which, oddly, it usually is...).
        - Added _submit_login method which can be overridden if needed to
          provide more control over the login form.
        - Fixed docs for submit_form.
        - Included Navigator and Poster in the distribution...

        - Added follow_to and follow_link methods.

          logged in.

        - Cleaned Bebo-specific code from Base.pm

        - Renamed Sitebase -> Sitebase::Navigator.
          - Structure now is:

              could be used for almost any module.

              web sites

        First version.
        Includes WWW::Sitebase and WWW::Sitebase::Base, which
        is my general base class with handy generic parsing and
        load/save methods and should probably be renamed to
        "BaseClass" or something.
